	优食图谱（USAtlas）是一个基于体质辨识的食材分类检索系统。体质分类是中医体质学研究的基础与核心内容，是从机体的复杂特性<br />中提炼出有关规律和标准，最终建成体质分类系统。体质辨识就是根据九种基本生理体质为基准去认知机体对象，从体质状态的特性，<br />把握其健康与疾病的整体要素与个体差异的手段，从而制定防治原则，选择相应的治疗、预防、养生的方法，进行“因人制宜”的干预。中医讲究“药膳同源”的理念，那么药膳食材与中药材无异，也需要讨论、研究其性味、归经、功效等，以对应各种体制状态的常见表现，从而制定出一种合适的药膳配方。
	该系统基于体制辨识的药膳食材的分类和药膳配方而设计，对于“治未病”找到更合理的配方，同时，将药膳食材根据种类、产地、部位进行详细的划分，给用户推荐最优质的食材。对于搜索情况进行统计，根据四时之变，做出食材分析曲线图。对于不同地域，食材使用程度进行详细的统计，做出地域体质统计图。
	本文阐述的药膳食材系统设计与开发思想，使用ThinkPHP作为开发框架，运用Smarty作为模板引擎，应用JQuery、ExtJS等技术实心交互视图模型。

	Constitution classification is the basis of the constitution of Traditional Chinese Medicine study and the core of the content, derived from the body of the complex characteristics of relevant laws and standards, eventually built the physique classification system. Constitution identification is based on nine kinds of basic physical fitness as a benchmark to get cognitive to the object, from the characteristics of physical state, grasping the overall health and disease factors and individual differences, to formulate prevention principles, choosing the corresponding treatment, prevention and curing methods, "they intend" intervention. Chinese emphasize the concept of "medicinal food homology", and then the medicine dietary ingredients and medicinal herbs, and it also needs to discuss and study its sexual flavour, return, efficacy, etc., with corresponding common performance of various system states, so as to develop an appropriate herbal formula. 
	The system is based on system identification of medicine diet material classification and herbal formula designed for "cure is not ill" to find a more reasonable formula,  at the same time, the medicine diet material according to the type, origin, placing a detailed division, recommending the best quality ingredients to the user. Take statistics for the search, according to the elements of change, the ingredient analysis graph. For different regions, the extent of ingredients used in detail, make the regional and physical statistical figure. 
	Medicine diet material system introduced in this paper is to contain 5 module, using ThinkPHP as a development framework, using the Smarty as atemplate engine, using the JQuery, ExtJS and so on technics as the solid interaction view model.
